# Test-driven development with Python
### Obey the testing goat
This repo will house all of my material and collateral as I work through the TDD w/ Python book (well, ebook, well, HTML book) by Harry J.W. Percival. The HTML version of the book can be found [here](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/), and the book is available on the internets (psh, for a fortune).

Instead of taking my usual Dockerized/Jupyter approach, I'm going to try to do this project with just Docker and the source code. Finally learn how to structure *multiple files* oh yeah.

Welp, that was short lived. The prerequisites of this book recommend knowing, well, more about python than I currently do. So I'm going to take a quick detour through the *Learn Python the Hard Way* book ([found here](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)), and then we'll carry on with TDD. Seriously, I'll be right back.
